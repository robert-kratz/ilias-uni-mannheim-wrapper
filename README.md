## Description:

This is a wrapper for the University of Mannheim's Ilias learning platform. The goal of the application is to make it easier and faster for students to organize files from their courses.

- **Functionality**:
    - The app acts as a wrapper, simplifying access to course files.
    - Through authentication in the app, files can be retrieved, organized, and stored.
    - This reduces the number of links and steps between the user and the desired file.

- **Storage of login credentials (optional)**:
    - The university ID and password can be securely stored in the device's operating system storage:
        - macOS: Keychain
        - Windows: (Windows storage solution)
        - Linux: (Linux storage solution)
    - This allows users to skip manual password entry. The credentials remain stored on the user's device.
