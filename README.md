## Description

This is a wrapper for the University of Mannheim's Ilias learning platform. The goal of the application is to make it easier and faster for students to organize files from their courses.

- **Functionality**:

  - The app acts as a wrapper, simplifying access to course files.
  - Through authentication in the app, files can be retrieved, organized, and stored.
  - This reduces the number of links and steps between the user and the desired file.

- **Storage of login credentials (optional)**:
  - The university ID and password can be securely stored in the device's operating system storage:
    - macOS: Keychain
    - Windows: (Windows storage solution)
    - Linux: (Linux storage solution)
  - This allows users to skip manual password entry. The credentials remain stored on the user's device.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: The application is built with Node.js and requires it to run.
- **Ilias Account**: The application requires a valid Ilias account to access the learning platform.
- **Chrome**: The application uses the Chromium browser to display the Ilias platform.
